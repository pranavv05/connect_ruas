Hey, just a suggestion from my side that is when someone enters a website
 they get most of their work done in the main page without going anywhere in the
  website. My suggestion is that u can make all the search we do in the main page without 
  us going to the dashboard, it feels a little weird that when u enter a website u tell 
  them to click dashboard to do their activity that happens in the website. I am trying 
  to tell is that make the main page functional in the sense add the features of the 
dashboard to the main show up page. Ya that's it!!!
